# Network Intrusion Detection

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. Some IDSâ€™s are capable of responding to detected intrusion upon discovery. These are classified as intrusion prevention systems (IPS). This application detects Network Intrusion using Machine Learning algorithm Random Forest with an accuracy of 94.3%.
