# Network Intrusion Detection

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. Some IDSâ€™s are capable of responding to detected intrusion upon discovery. These are classified as intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
